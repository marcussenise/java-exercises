 - Challenge - IFB/desafioCriptoIFB:
   I found this challenge from a Brazilian Institute and I decided to resolve it.   
   This challenge asked to build an app that changes every letter of a text for another letter x positions after, where the 'x' is chosen by the user.
   Ex:   x=2
   The string "Diego" would transform in "Fkgiq".
